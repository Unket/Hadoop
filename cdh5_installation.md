## CDH 5 INSTALLATION

 Assuming you have basic knowledge of hadoop we are going ahead with the `cdh 5` installation on `google console`. We created two instances namenode and datanode both having `RHEL 7`.

### Login as root and set password
```vim
sudo su root
```
```vim
Passwd
```
```
Enter password ********
Reenter password ********
```
### Disable firewall
```
systemctl stop firewalld
Service firewalld start
chkconfig firewalld off
```


### To stop iptables and even after the reboot:

```
systemctl stop iptables && chkconfig iptables off
systemctl stop ip6tables && chkconfig ip6tables off
```

### Disable SELINUX
```sh
vi /etc/selinux/config
```
open the above file and change the attribute of SELINUX to `disabled`
##### SELINUX=disabled
System is to be rebooted for the changes to take effect

### SSH Passwordless Keygen

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa 
```
or
```
ssh -keygen 
```
* Now that we generated ssh-keygen, we go to sshd_config and change `permitrootlogin` to `yes`
And  `passwordauthentication` to `yes`
```
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
* After setting above attributes we must Restart sshd 
```
service sshd restart
```
* Create a file named authorized_keys in namenode as well as datanode
* Copy public key which is in id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys
```
cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
```
* Secure copy the authorized_keys to all other nodes
```
scp authorized_keys datanode:/root/.ssh/test
```
##### Try
```
Ssh datanode
```
##### Do this to all other nodes and youâ€™ll be able to login to other nodes without any prompt for password



### Install web Server in all the servers:

```
yum install -y httpd
```
```
service httpd start && chkconfig httpd on
```






### CDH INSTALLATION
